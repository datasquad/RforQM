## Welcome to R Projects for Quantitative Methods

This site will link to small empirical projects which are designed to support students of Econometrics and Quantitative Methods at The University of Manchester. These projects are written for users of R.

Some basic introductory material for those who want to learn R can be found on the [ECLR Wiki](http://eclr.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/R). The projects on this page are meant to support students who study substantial econometric and statistical techniques. The discussion of these techniques is fairly rudimentary here and we assume that you supplement your studies with teh respective material.

Some larger empirical projects are provided on the [Doing Economics Section](https://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/) or the [CORE-ECON Project](https://www.core-econ.org/).

## Simple Data Handling and Data Analysis

These projects give some exposure to basic data-handling and fairly straightforward statistical analysis.
